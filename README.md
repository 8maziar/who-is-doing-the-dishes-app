What your application does,
Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
   
This project uses **Dart** and **Flutter** to create a useful, mobile-friendly application to help users manage their household chores.  After creating an account, users can see their assigned tasks and by when they need completing.  They can also assign tasks to both themselves and other users in the household and can be notified of this via push notifications.  They can see which chores are the most urgent and need completing first and can mark tasks as complete.  They can then share their success with other household users upon completion of tasks.

-  **Dart** is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, server-side programming, and mobile app development.  Find out more about Dart here:  [https://dart.dev/](y)

-  **Flutter** is an open source framework developed and supported by Google. Frontend and full-stack developers use Flutter to build an application's user interface (UI) for multiple platforms with a single codebase.  Find the documentation here:  [https://flutter.dev/](y)


(What challenges did we face?  Implementing push notifications, getting to grips with and installing new tech stacks (BE/FE) and using these across web/emulators/differing OS, calendar, adding and assigning/editing/deleting chores, using images/animations, authentification, accessibility, etc???)
